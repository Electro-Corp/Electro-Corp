# Electro-Corp
Hey there<br>
I make stuff in C++/C and sometimes in Python <br>
I put stuff I make here when it gets to a point that I think is ready to be put here <br>
Some of my favorites:<br>
* The unfinished Nexus 3D Engine: https://github.com/nx-software/nexus
* Top Down MC Ripoff (test to see how well I know Python/Pygame) https://github.com/Electro-Corp/Top-down-minecraft-ripoff
* I would put my OS on here, but its still not ready in my opinion 
* Text Editor in Python with Syntax Highlighting: https://github.com/Electro-Corp/Python-Text-Editor
* Logic Gates (and/or/not/etc) simulation program(still in dev): https://github.com/Electro-Corp/LogicGates
* Linux wget command GUI Edition: https://github.com/Electro-Corp/WgetGUI
